# WaterMe watchOS App

This directory hosts the SwiftUI implementation for the Apple Watch companion application. The module currently includes a simple gauge with quick-add hydration buttons and a reset control to illustrate the app structure.

## Next steps

- Integrate WatchConnectivity to sync with the paired iPhone Expo app.
- Add WidgetKit targets for complications and lock-screen widgets.
- Implement haptic feedback for hydration events and subscription gating.
