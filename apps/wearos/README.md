# WaterMe Wear OS App

This module contains the Wear OS implementation of WaterMe using Jetpack Compose. It currently provides a placeholder UI with quick-add hydration buttons and a reset action.

## Next steps

- Integrate Firebase authentication via custom tokens shared from the mobile app.
- Synchronise hydration logs with Firestore using background workers.
- Implement complications and haptics for add actions.
